## Parveen Kumar Tiwari
Machine Learning | Data Analyst | Data Scientist

As a data professional with expertise in machine learning, data analysis, MySQL, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP), I have a proven track record of developing cutting-edge solutions and delivering impactful results. I have a strong proficiency in  Python programming languages  as well as experience with popular libraries and frameworks including TensorFlow, Keras, NLTK, and Gensim.

 I have recently joined the M. Tech. (Executive) program in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning at the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Jammu, where I am honing my skills and knowledge in advanced AI and ML techniques.

 I am passionate about leveraging data to uncover meaningful insights and solve complex problems. I have a deep understanding of data analysis techniques, including data preprocessing, data visualization, statistical analysis, and database management using MySQL. Additionally, I have hands-on experience in developing and implementing machine learning models for various tasks such as customer churn prediction, sentiment analysis, and image recognition.

 With my strong analytical skills, attention to detail, and ability to communicate complex concepts to non-technical stakeholders, I have consistently delivered data-driven insights that have informed strategic decision-making and resulted in tangible business outcomes. I am now eager to leverage my skills and experience to contribute to meaningful projects on GitHub, collaborate with like-minded professionals, and continue my passion for data-driven innovation.
